# Background

(ref:resiliencecurve) Conceptual depiction of time dependent system behaviour (c.f. @guo_resilience_2021)

```{r resiliencecurve, fig.cap="(ref:resiliencecurve)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/resilience-classical-description.png")
```

Several researchers have described the generic concept of disruption and recovery with respect to service provision, transportation infrastructures from a performance-based perspective, e.g. @vugrin_recoverysequencing_2014, GLUCH, @koelle_resilience_2015. 
These approaches identify distinct phases. 
Fig. \@ref(fig:resiliencecurve) depicts these phases.

<!-- literal ======= change ----------->
proposed the generic concept of
disruption and recovery underlying performance-based
approaches, which is a time-dependent function F(t). Under
noral operating conditions, the system performance
measure F has a nominal value, until the system suffering a
disruption at the time t0, as illustrated in Figure 1.
(e resilience formulation is the ratio of recovery to loss:

$$R(t) = \frac{F(t) - F_{min}}{F_0 - F_{min}}$$

## heading 2

some cool text etc

* bullet 
* more bullets
* one more bullet

### heading 3

cool text and cool reference .

possibly some code chunks

```{r}
# this could be code
```
